This file is to intruduce the data sets collected for machine 
learning algorithm verification. The data set is often too big 
to be able to be uploaded into the server. But you can download
according to the URL on the data description part. The experimental 
results can be found in the the directory \\\ml-libs\experiment. 

If you think a data set is good, feel free to add it.

==== Data Format ====
1. Dense 
  <label> <value1> <value2> ... <valueN>

  All features are listed sequentially with the SPACE delimiter. 

2. Sparse
  <label> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> ...

  The pair <index>:<value> gives a feature value, where <index>
  is an integer starting from 1 and <value> is a real number. 
  The features with the zero value are ignored. This format 
  is used in LIBSVM, LIBLINEAR, SVMLight, etc.
