This file is to intruduce the data sets collected for machine 
learning algorithm verification. The data set is often too big 
to be able to be uploaded into the server. But you can download
according to the URL on the data description part. The experimental 
results can be found in the the directory \\\ml-libs\experiment. 

If you think a data set is good, feel free to add it.

==== Data Format ====
1. Dense 
  <label> <value1> <value2> ... <valueN>

  All features are listed sequentially with the SPACE delimiter. 

2. Sparse
  <label> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> ...

  The pair <index>:<value> gives a feature value, where <index>
  is an integer starting from 1 and <value> is a real number. 
  The features with the zero value are ignored. This format 
  is used in LIBSVM, LIBLINEAR, SVMLight, etc.

  Comments: Predict jank URL based on the host info and url
            keywords. It sequencially samples data for 120 
	    days for online learning. We only use the first 
	    two day data for train and test.

  Comment: 10-K reports from thousands of publicly traded U.S. 
           companies, published in 1996-2006 and stock return 
	   volatility measurements in the twelve-month period 
	   before and the twelve-month period after each report.
